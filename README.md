# 100DaysOfSwift
 
These are the projects worked on during Paul Hudson's #100DaysOfSwift, found @ https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/

I participated in this challenge when it was going on (around March to May...ish 2019), but originally had each project as its own git repo. I just went through (on 11/7/19) and merged all repos into one main repo... and hopefully didn't mess up each project or the history too much with the custom shell script I was running over each repo.

^ That's just a note for anyone looking in this repo (if things look a little weird), or for myself in the future if I can't remember what was going on!
